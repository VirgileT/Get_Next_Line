# get_next_line

Welcome to my `get_next_line` project!  
This funny project,challenges us to implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor.  
See the [subject](https://github.com/VirgileT/Get_Next_Line/blob/main/SUBJECT_Get_Next_Line.pdf)
## Project Overview

The `get_next_line` function is designed to read a line ending with a newline character (`'\n'`) from a file descriptor. Key features include:

- **Buffer Management:**
  - Efficiently manage a buffer to read data from the file descriptor.

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
  - Utilize dynamic memory allocation to handle lines of variable length.

- **Multiple File Descriptors:**
  - Adapt the function to read from multiple file descriptors without losing context.

## Contents

- **`/srcs/`:** Contains the source files, including the main `get_next_line` function.
- **`/include/`:** Header files, including `get_next_line.h`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/srcs/` directory and review the source files.
3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile (`make`).
4. Create a test program or use the provided test cases to ensure your `get_next_line` functions correctly.

Special thanks to Ecole 42 for the inspiration and learning opportunity.
